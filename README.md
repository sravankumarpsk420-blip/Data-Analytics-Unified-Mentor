📊 Key Insights

⦁	Medal concentration is highly skewed — a handful of countries (USA, Soviet Union, Australia, Germany, China) dominate the medal tally.
⦁	USA leads with 1992 total medals during 1976–2008.
⦁	Gender participation increased significantly, with women earning 5928 medals vs 9388 by men.
⦁	Country specialization observed in sports like swimming, athletics, and gymnastics.
⦁	Forecasting generated estimated medal counts for 2012, 2016, 2020 based on historical trends.

📈 Machine Learning Forecasting

Using a Random Forest Regressor, future medal counts were predicted for:
⦁	2012 Olympics
⦁	2016 Olympics
⦁	2020 Olympics

Predictions were later exported into an Excel file.
