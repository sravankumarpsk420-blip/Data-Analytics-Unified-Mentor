# Global Life Expectancy Analysis: Determinants, Trends, and Insights (2000–2015)

## 📘 Project Overview

This project explores the key determinants of life expectancy across 193 countries using data sourced from trusted global organizations:

Life Expectancy & Health Indicators: WHO – Global Health Observatory (GHO)

Economic Indicators: United Nations data repository

The dataset spans 2000–2015, a period marked by rapid improvements in global healthcare systems, especially in developing nations.
The project's primary aim is to analyze how health, economic, and social factors influence life expectancy, and how countries can take action to improve longevity.


🎯 Objectives

- Identify which predicting factors significantly affect life expectancy.
- Analyze mortality rates and their influence on lifespan.
- Understand the impact of immunization and disease prevalence.
- Assess the relationship between lifestyle, economic status, and social well-being on life expectancy.
- Provide actionable insights for countries with low life expectancy (<65 years).

## 📂 Data Description
Categories of Factors Considered

To simplify the analysis, all variables were grouped into four broad categories:

**1. Immunization Factors**
- Hepatitis-B
- Polio
- Measles
- Diphtheria
These indicate vaccination coverage and readiness against infectious diseases.

**2. Mortality Factors**
- Adult Mortality
- Infant Deaths
- Under-5 Deaths
- BMI
- HIV/AIDS
- Thinness (1–19 years)
- Thinness (5–9 years)
Indicators reflecting death risk and general health conditions.

**3. Economic Factors**
GDP
- Expenditure
-- Total Expenditure (Health)
- Income Composition
- Population
Reflect national wealth, healthcare funding, and demographic pressure.

**4. Social Factors**
- Schooling (Years of Education)
- Alcohol Consumption
- Status (Developed/Developing)
Represent societal well-being, lifestyle, and behavioral habits.

## 📈 Results & Analysis

### A. Mortality Analysis
**a) Adult Mortality**
- Higher adult mortality sharply decreases life expectancy. This is supported by the correlation: adult mortality = –0.60.
**b) Infant Death Analysis**
- Infant deaths are negatively correlated (–0.17) with life expectancy, but the effect is not as strong as adult mortality.
**c) Polio Immunization Impact**
- Countries with high immunization coverage have significantly higher life expectancy, supported by Polio correlation: 0.42
Diphtheria also has a strong positive correlation: 0.43

## 🧭 Research Questions — Insights from Data
📌 Most selected factors show strong relationships with life expectancy.
**Top positive predictors**:
- Income Composition (0.58)
- Schooling (0.56)
- BMI (0.50)

**Top negative predictors**:
- Adult Mortality (–0.60)
- HIV prevalence (–0.50)
- Thinness indicators (–0.39 each)

📌 **Healthcare Investment:** Countries with low life expectancy invest much less in healthcare. Increasing healthcare allocation is essential for improving public health and lifespan.

📌 **Adult & Child Mortality:** Adult mortality has the highest negative impact on life expectancy (–0.60). Infant & under-5 deaths also reduce life expectancy but with smaller correlations (–0.17 and –0.19). Improving emergency care, maternal health, and medical infrastructure is crucial.

📌 **BMI & Alcohol:** BMI positively correlated (0.50) → Healthy weight = longer lifespan. Alcohol shows positive correlation (0.35), but moderate consumption in some developed countries biases the result. This does **not** imply alcohol increases lifespan. Lifestyle has a meaningful influence but is contextual.

📌 **Education:** Schooling is a major driver of better life outcomes.

📌 **Alcohol Clarification:** Alcohol does not directly increase life expectancy.

📌 **Population Density:** Has no significant impact on life expectancy.

📌 **Immunization:** Higher immunization → longer lifespan → fewer deaths → better disease prevention.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:
- KPIs (Avg Life Expectancy, Avg Immunization, Mortality Levels etc)
- Trend Lines (2000–2015)
- Choropleth World Maps
- Bar Charts
- Scatter Plots
- Slicers for dynamic filtering

---

## 📝 Conclusion

This study clearly demonstrates that life expectancy is a multidimensional outcome, influenced by health infrastructure, economic stability, education, and disease prevention.

**Key determinants**:
- Lower adult mortality
- Better immunization coverage
- Higher income composition
- More schooling
- Higher GDP & health expenditure

**Countries with low life expectancy (<65) must focus on**:
- Increasing healthcare investment
- Improving adult and maternal health programs
- Strengthening immunization programs
- Raising educational standards
- Reducing HIV prevalence & malnutrition
- Improving lifestyle awareness programs

## 🚀 Future Recommendations

- Prioritize preventive healthcare (vaccination, screenings)
- Increase GDP contribution to health
- Expand public health education
- Ensure child nutrition to reduce thinness
- Monitor lifestyle & chronic diseases
- Implement targeted interventions for high-mortality regions
